"What factors could cause actual results to differ from McDonald's management's expectations, as stated in the forward-looking statements?","The factors that could cause actual results to differ from McDonald's management's expectations, as stated in the forward-looking statements, include:

1. **Macroeconomic Conditions**: Adverse global and regional economic conditions can materially affect the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Factors such as slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations can impact consumer confidence and spending.

2. **Consumer Confidence and Spending**: Changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors can adversely affect consumer confidence and spending, which in turn can affect demand for the Company's products and services.

3. **Impact on Suppliers and Partners**: Uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions can significantly impact the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, and other channel partners, potentially leading to financial instability or insolvency.

These factors, among others, could lead to actual results differing from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.","["" and previously non-public information.\n\nABOUT McDONALD’S\n\nMcDonald’s is the world’s leading global foodservice retailer with over 40,000 locations in over 100 countries.

How is earnings per share calculated and reported in the financial statements of McDonald's Corporation?,"Earnings per share (EPS) for McDonald's Corporation is calculated and reported in the financial statements as follows:

1. **Basic Earnings Per Share**: This is calculated by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding during the period. For McDonald's, the basic earnings per share for the years reported were:
   - 2023: $6.16
   - 2022: $6.15
   - 2021: $5.67

2. **Diluted Earnings Per Share**: This is calculated by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding, which includes the effect of dilutive share-based awards. For McDonald's, the diluted earnings per share for the years reported were:
   - 2023: $6.13
   - 2022: $6.11
   - 2021: $5.61

The financial statements also note that approximately 24 million restricted stock units (RSUs) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive. 

The shares used in computing earnings per share were:
- Basic: 15,744,231 (2023), 16,215,963 (2022), 16,701,272 (2021)
- Diluted: 15,812,547 (2023), 16,325,819 (2022), 16,864,919 (2021)","[""ize ways of working (Accelerating the Organization).\n\nExcluding the above items, results reflected positive operating performance driven primarily by higher sales-driven Franchised\n\nmargins, partly offset by higher Selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE-DILUTED RECONCILIATION\n\nDollars in millions, except per share data\n\nQuarters Ended March 31,\n\nNet Income\n\nEarnings per share - diluted\n\nGAAP\n\n(Gains)/charges\n\nNon-GAAP\n\n2023 $ 1,929 $ 1,802 134 $ 1,957 $ 1,936\n\n2024\n\n27\n\nInc/ (Dec)\n\n7 %\n\n1 %\n\nInc/ (Dec) Excluding Currency Translation\n\n7 % $\n\n1 % $\n\n2024 2.66 $ 0.04 2.70 $\n\n2023 2.45 0.18 2.63\n\nInc/ (Dec)\n\n9 %\n\n2 %\n\nInc/ (Dec) Excluding Currency Translation\n\n9 %\n\n2 %\n\n2\n\nTHE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASE\n\nConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at\n\nprior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and\n\ntransactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees. Systemwide sales\n\nto loyalty members is comprised of all sales to customers who self-identify as a loyalty member when transacting with both Company- owned and operated and franchised restaurants. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are measured across approximately 50 markets with loyalty programs. Systemwide sales to loyalty members represents an aggregation of the prior four quarters of sales to loyalty members active in the last 90 days. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n\nFree cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.\n\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information\n\nrelated to the Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nMcDonald’s Corporation will broadcast its investor earnings conference call live over the Internet at 7:30 a.m. (Central Time) on\n\nApril 30, 2024.

How has McDonald's global reach affected its finances lately?,"McDonald's global reach has had a significant impact on its finances recently. A majority of the company's total net sales come from international markets, which means that growth in international trade generally benefits the company. However, there are challenges associated with this global presence. 

Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and controls on imports and exports, can adversely affect McDonald's operations and supply chain, potentially limiting its ability to distribute products and services effectively. This impact can be particularly severe in regions where the company derives a significant portion of its revenues. 

Moreover, fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can also affect the company's financials. A weakening of foreign currencies can decrease the dollar value of its foreign sales and earnings, leading to potential price increases that may reduce demand. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies could benefit sales but might also lead to increased costs for components priced in those currencies.

Overall, while McDonald's global reach allows for substantial revenue generation, it also exposes the company to various risks that can materially affect its financial performance.","["" and previously non-public information.\n\nABOUT McDONALD’S\n\nMcDonald’s is the world’s leading global foodservice retailer with over 40,000 locations in over 100 countries.

Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and\n\ntransactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees. Systemwide sales\n\nto loyalty members is comprised of all sales to customers who self-identify as a loyalty member when transacting with both Company- owned and operated and franchised restaurants. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are measured across approximately 50 markets with loyalty programs. Systemwide sales to loyalty members represents an aggregation of the prior four quarters of sales to loyalty members active in the last 90 days. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n\nFree cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.\n\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information\n\nrelated to the Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nMcDonald’s Corporation will broadcast its investor earnings conference call live over the Internet at 7:30 a.m. (Central Time) on\n\nApril 30, 2024.
