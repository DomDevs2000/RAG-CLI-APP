What allegations has Epic Games made against Apple in their lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California?,"In their lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Epic Games made several allegations against Apple, primarily focused on anti-competitive practices. Here are some key points of their claims:

1. **Monopolistic Behavior**: Epic Games alleged that Apple holds a monopoly over the distribution of apps on its iOS platform, particularly through its App Store. They argued that Apple's control over the App Store and its policies restrict competition and harm consumers.

2. **Unfair App Store Policies**: Epic claimed that Apple's requirement for developers to use its in-app payment system, which includes a 30% commission on sales, is anti-competitive and constitutes an unfair business practice. They argued that this commission is excessive and limits developers' ability to offer competitive pricing.

3. **Restricting Alternatives**: The lawsuit contended that Apple's policies prevent developers from informing users about alternative payment methods outside of the App Store, which further stifles competition.

4. **Retaliation against Epic**: Epic Games also claimed that Apple retaliated against them for introducing a direct payment option in their game, Fortnite, which violated Apple's App Store guidelines. This led to Fortnite being removed from the App Store, which Epic argued was an abuse of Apple's market power.

These allegations were part of a broader challenge to Apple's business practices and its control over the mobile app ecosystem. Epic sought to have the court declare Apple's practices illegal and to enable more competition in the app distribution market.","[' Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 18\n\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the European Commission (the “Commission”) announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. If the Commission concludes that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and will continue to engage with the Commission as it conducts its investigations.\n\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and 16 state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nEpic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On March 13, 2024, Epic filed a motion with the California District Court disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction. The Company has filed an opposition to Epic’s motion. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.

How is shareholders' equity calculated and what components are included in it?,"Shareholders' equity, also known as owner's equity or stockholders' equity, represents the residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting its liabilities. It is a key component of a company's balance sheet and provides insight into the financial health of the business. 

### Calculation of Shareholders' Equity

Shareholders' equity can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Shareholders' Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities} \]

### Components of Shareholders' Equity

1. **Common Stock**: The value of the shares issued to shareholders. It represents the initial investment made by shareholders in exchange for ownership in the company.

2. **Preferred Stock**: A class of stock that typically has preferential rights over common stock, such as fixed dividends and priority in asset distribution upon liquidation.

3. **Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)**: The amount received from shareholders in excess of the par value of the stock. This includes any premiums paid during stock issuances.

4. **Retained Earnings**: The cumulative amount of net income that has been retained in the company rather than distributed as dividends. It reflects the company’s reinvestment in its operations.

5. **Treasury Stock**: The cost of shares that were repurchased by the company. This is a contra-equity account and reduces total shareholders' equity.

6. **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)**: This includes unrealized gains and losses that are not included in net income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in the value of certain investments.

### Summary

In summary, shareholders' equity is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, and it consists of various components including common stock, preferred stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, treasury stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income. Understanding these components helps assess a company's financial stability and performance.","['Adjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included\n\nin net income\n\n59\n\n62\n\n134\n\n127\n\nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on\n\nmarketable debt securities\n\n52\n\n1,465\n\n3,172\n\n2,430\n\nTotal other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\n418\n\n1,166\n\n2,492\n\n(637)\n\nTotal comprehensive income\n\n$\n\n24,054 $\n\n25,326 $\n\n60,044 $\n\n53,521\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 2\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited) (In millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and par value)\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nASSETS:\n\nCurrent assets:\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n32,695 $\n\nMarketable securities\n\n34,455\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n21,837\n\nVendor non-trade receivables\n\n19,313\n\nInventories\n\n6,232\n\nOther current assets\n\n13,884\n\nTotal current assets\n\n128,416\n\nNon-current assets:\n\nMarketable securities\n\n95,187\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n43,546\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n70,262\n\nTotal non-current assets\n\n208,995\n\nTotal assets\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable\n\n$\n\n45,753 $\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n57,298\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n8,012\n\nCommercial paper\n\n1,997\n\nTerm debt\n\n10,762\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n123,822\n\nNon-current liabilities:\n\nTerm debt\n\n91,831\n\nOther non-current liabilities\n\n47,564\n\nTotal non-current liabilities\n\n139,395\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n263,217\n\nCommitments and contingencies\n\nShareholders’ equity:\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital, $0.00001 par value: 50,400,000 shares\n\nauthorized; 15,337,686 and 15,550,061 shares issued and outstanding, respectively\n\n78,815\n\nRetained earnings/(Accumulated deficit)\n\n4,339\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n(8,960)\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity\n\n74,194\n\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 3\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\n29,965\n\n31,590\n\n29,508\n\n31,477\n\n6,331\n\n14,695\n\n143,566\n\n100,544\n\n43,715\n\n64,758\n\n209,017\n\n352,583\n\n62,611\n\n58,829\n\n8,061\n\n5,985\n\n9,822\n\n145,308\n\n95,281\n\n49,848\n\n145,129\n\n290,437\n\n73,812\n\n(214)\n\n(11,452)\n\n62,146\n\n352,583\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (Unaudited) (In millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSix Months Ended\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity, beginning balances\n\n$\n\n74,100 $\n\n56,727 $\n\n62,146 $\n\n50,672\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital:\n\nBeginning balances\n\n75,236\n\n66,399\n\n73,812\n\n64,849\n\nCommon stock issued\n\n752\n\n690\n\n752\n\n690\n\nCommon stock withheld related to net share settlement\n\nof equity awards\n\n(222)\n\n(281)\n\n(1,882)\n\n(1,715)\n\n']","Shareholders' equity is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets.

How does the company adjust its cost in relation to unrealized gains and losses in its financial statements?,"In financial reporting, unrealized gains and losses refer to the changes in the value of investments or assets that have not yet been sold. Companies adjust their financial statements to reflect these unrealized gains and losses, which can affect both the balance sheet and the income statement. Here’s how this typically works:

1. **Balance Sheet Adjustments**: 
   - Unrealized gains and losses are usually recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet under ""Other Comprehensive Income"" (OCI). This is common for available-for-sale securities and certain types of financial instruments.
   - For trading securities, unrealized gains and losses are recognized directly in the income statement, affecting net income.

2. **Income Statement Adjustments**: 
   - For trading securities, the unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings for the period, impacting the company's net income.
   - For available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses are not included in net income until the asset is sold. Instead, they are reported in OCI, which is a component of total equity.

3. **Impact on Financial Ratios**: 
   - The recognition of unrealized gains and losses can influence financial ratios. For instance, net income will be affected by unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, while equity may be impacted by changes in OCI for available-for-sale securities.

4. **Disclosure Requirements**: 
   - Companies are required to disclose their accounting policies regarding the treatment of unrealized gains and losses, as well as the nature and extent of their financial instruments and associated risks.

5. **Tax Implications**: 
   - Unrealized gains are generally not taxable until they are realized (i.e., when the asset is sold). However, companies may need to consider deferred tax assets or liabilities related to these unrealized gains and losses.

Overall, the treatment of unrealized gains and losses helps provide a clearer picture of a company's financial position and performance, ensuring that stakeholders have a comprehensive understanding of potential future cash flows associated with these assets.","['September 30, 2023\n\nAdjusted Cost\n\nUnrealized Gains\n\nUnrealized Losses\n\nFair Value\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCurrent Marketable Securities\n\nNon-Current Marketable Securities\n\nCash\n\n$ 28,359 $\n\n— $\n\n— $ 28,359 $\n\n28,359 $\n\n— $\n\n—\n\nLevel 1:\n\nMoney market funds\n\n481\n\n—\n\n—\n\n481\n\n481\n\n—\n\n—\n\nMutual funds and equity securities\n\n442\n\n12\n\n(26)\n\n428\n\n—\n\n428\n\n—\n\nSubtotal\n\n923\n\n12\n\n(26)\n\n909\n\n481\n\n428\n\n—\n\nLevel 2 (1):\n\nU.S. Treasury securities\n\n19,406\n\n—\n\n(1,292)\n\n18,114\n\n35\n\n5,468\n\n12,611\n\nU.S. agency securities\n\n5,736\n\n—\n\n(600)\n\n5,136\n\n36\n\n271\n\n4,829\n\nNon-U.S. government securities\n\n17,533\n\n6\n\n(1,048)\n\n16,491\n\n—\n\n11,332\n\n5,159\n\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n\n1,354\n\n—\n\n—\n\n1,354\n\n1,034\n\n320\n\n—\n\nCommercial paper\n\n608\n\n—\n\n—\n\n608\n\n—\n\n608\n\n—\n\nCorporate debt securities\n\n76,840\n\n6\n\n(5,956)\n\n70,890\n\n20\n\n12,627\n\n58,243\n\nMunicipal securities\n\n628\n\n—\n\n(26)\n\n602\n\n—\n\n192\n\n410\n\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n\n22,365\n\n6\n\n(2,735)\n\n19,636\n\n—\n\n344\n\n19,292\n\nSubtotal\n\n144,470\n\n18\n\n(11,657)\n\n132,831\n\n1,125\n\n31,162\n\n100,544\n\nTotal (2)\n\n$ 173,752 $\n\n30 $\n\n(11,683) $ 162,099 $\n\n29,965 $\n\n31,590 $\n\n100,544\n\n(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\n(2) As of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $14.0 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.\n\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of March 30, 2024 (in millions):\n\nDue after 1 year through 5 years\n\n$\n\n67,987\n\nDue after 5 years through 10 years\n\n9,108\n\nDue after 10 years\n\n18,092\n\nTotal fair value\n\n$\n\n95,187\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\n\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.

How does the issuance of common stock impact the shareholders' equity of Apple Inc.?,"The issuance of common stock impacts the shareholders' equity of Apple Inc. in several ways:

1. **Increase in Shareholders' Equity**: When Apple issues common stock, it raises capital, which increases the total shareholders' equity on the balance sheet. This is because the funds received from the sale of the stock are recorded as additional paid-in capital.

2. **Dilution of Ownership**: Existing shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership percentage. This means that their proportionate share of the company decreases, as the total number of outstanding shares increases. However, if the capital raised is used effectively to generate growth, it may lead to an increase in the overall value of the company, potentially offsetting the effects of dilution.

3. **Impact on Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: The issuance of additional shares can affect the earnings per share metric. If Apple generates a consistent or growing net income but has more shares outstanding, the EPS may decrease, which could impact investor perception and stock valuation.

4. **Use of Proceeds**: The impact on shareholders' equity also depends on how Apple uses the proceeds from the stock issuance. If the funds are invested in profitable projects or used to pay down debt, it can enhance the company's overall value, benefiting shareholders in the long run.

5. **Market Perception**: The market's reaction to the issuance of common stock can also influence shareholders' equity. If investors view the issuance positively, it may lead to an increase in the stock price, benefiting all shareholders. Conversely, if the market perceives the issuance negatively, it could lead to a decline in stock price.

Overall, the issuance of common stock can have both immediate and long-term effects on shareholders' equity, and its overall impact largely depends on the company's strategic use of the capital raised.","['Adjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included\n\nin net income\n\n59\n\n62\n\n134\n\n127\n\nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on\n\nmarketable debt securities\n\n52\n\n1,465\n\n3,172\n\n2,430\n\nTotal other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\n418\n\n1,166\n\n2,492\n\n(637)\n\nTotal comprehensive income\n\n$\n\n24,054 $\n\n25,326 $\n\n60,044 $\n\n53,521\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 2\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited) (In millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and par value)\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nASSETS:\n\nCurrent assets:\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n32,695 $\n\nMarketable securities\n\n34,455\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n21,837\n\nVendor non-trade receivables\n\n19,313\n\nInventories\n\n6,232\n\nOther current assets\n\n13,884\n\nTotal current assets\n\n128,416\n\nNon-current assets:\n\nMarketable securities\n\n95,187\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n43,546\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n70,262\n\nTotal non-current assets\n\n208,995\n\nTotal assets\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable\n\n$\n\n45,753 $\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n57,298\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n8,012\n\nCommercial paper\n\n1,997\n\nTerm debt\n\n10,762\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n123,822\n\nNon-current liabilities:\n\nTerm debt\n\n91,831\n\nOther non-current liabilities\n\n47,564\n\nTotal non-current liabilities\n\n139,395\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n263,217\n\nCommitments and contingencies\n\nShareholders’ equity:\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital, $0.00001 par value: 50,400,000 shares\n\nauthorized; 15,337,686 and 15,550,061 shares issued and outstanding, respectively\n\n78,815\n\nRetained earnings/(Accumulated deficit)\n\n4,339\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n(8,960)\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity\n\n74,194\n\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 3\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\n29,965\n\n31,590\n\n29,508\n\n31,477\n\n6,331\n\n14,695\n\n143,566\n\n100,544\n\n43,715\n\n64,758\n\n209,017\n\n352,583\n\n62,611\n\n58,829\n\n8,061\n\n5,985\n\n9,822\n\n145,308\n\n95,281\n\n49,848\n\n145,129\n\n290,437\n\n73,812\n\n(214)\n\n(11,452)\n\n62,146\n\n352,583\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (Unaudited) (In millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSix Months Ended\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity, beginning balances\n\n$\n\n74,100 $\n\n56,727 $\n\n62,146 $\n\n50,672\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital:\n\nBeginning balances\n\n75,236\n\n66,399\n\n73,812\n\n64,849\n\nCommon stock issued\n\n752\n\n690\n\n752\n\n690\n\nCommon stock withheld related to net share settlement\n\nof equity awards\n\n(222)\n\n(281)\n\n(1,882)\n\n(1,715)\n\n']",The issuance of common stock impacts the shareholders' equity of Apple Inc. by increasing the common stock and additional paid-in capital.

What is the significance of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in relation to the certification of financial reports by executives of public companies like Apple Inc.?,"The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) was enacted in response to major corporate scandals, including those involving Enron and WorldCom, which undermined investor confidence in the financial markets. The act introduced significant reforms aimed at enhancing corporate governance and accountability, particularly concerning the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting.

One of the key provisions of SOX is the requirement for executives of public companies, such as Apple Inc., to personally certify the accuracy of financial statements. Here are some of the significant aspects of this requirement:

1. **Certification of Financial Reports**: Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that the CEO and CFO of a public company must certify the quarterly and annual financial reports. They must affirm that the reports do not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that they fairly present the company's financial condition and results of operations.

2. **Increased Accountability**: By requiring top executives to sign off on financial reports, SOX holds them directly accountable for the accuracy of the information presented to investors and regulators. This personal accountability is intended to deter fraudulent financial practices and enhance the integrity of financial reporting.

3. **Criminal Penalties**: SOX imposes severe penalties for executives who knowingly certify misleading financial reports. This includes potential fines and imprisonment, which serves as a strong incentive for executives to ensure the accuracy of their company's financial disclosures.

4. **Internal Controls**: The act also requires companies to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Section 404 specifically requires management to assess and report on the effectiveness of these controls, which adds another layer of accountability and oversight.

5. **Investor Confidence**: By improving the accuracy of financial reporting and holding executives accountable, SOX aims to restore investor confidence in the capital markets. This is particularly important for major public companies like Apple Inc., which rely on investor trust to maintain their market value and access to capital.

Overall, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has played a crucial role in shaping corporate governance practices and ensuring that executives of public companies are held accountable for the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting, thereby protecting investors and promoting transparency in the financial markets.","[' requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that information contained in such Form 10-Q fairly presents in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of Apple Inc. at the dates and for the periods indicated.\n\nDate: May 2, 2024\n\nBy:\n\n/s/ Timothy D.

How do EU DMA investigations affect Apple's financial reporting and fines?,"The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to ensure fair competition in the digital market, particularly targeting large tech companies like Apple. Investigations under the DMA can have several implications for Apple's financial reporting and potential fines:

1. **Financial Reporting**:
   - **Contingent Liabilities**: If Apple is under investigation, it may need to disclose contingent liabilities in its financial statements. This means they would have to indicate that there is a possibility of incurring fines or other financial penalties, which can affect investor perceptions and stock prices.
   - **Legal Expenses**: The costs associated with compliance, legal defenses, and any potential settlements or fines may need to be accounted for in their financial reports, impacting overall profitability.
   - **Revenue Impact**: Depending on the findings of the investigation, Apple may have to alter its business practices or adjust pricing strategies, which could lead to changes in revenue streams.

2. **Fines and Penalties**:
   - **Potential Fines**: If found in violation of the DMA, Apple could face substantial fines, which can be calculated as a percentage of its global revenue. This could lead to significant one-time expenses that would impact net income.
   - **Ongoing Compliance Costs**: Beyond initial fines, Apple may incur ongoing costs to comply with any regulatory changes mandated by the DMA, which could affect long-term profitability.

3. **Market Perception**: 
   - Investigations can lead to negative publicity, affecting investor confidence and potentially impacting stock performance. This can indirectly influence how Apple manages its financial reporting and strategic decisions.

4. **Strategic Adjustments**: 
   - Depending on the outcome of the investigations, Apple may need to adjust its business model or practices in Europe, which could lead to restructuring costs or changes in operational strategies that would be reflected in financial reports.

In summary, investigations under the DMA can have significant implications for Apple's financial reporting, including potential fines, increased legal and compliance costs, and impacts on revenue and market perception. The company will need to navigate these challenges carefully to maintain its financial health and investor confidence.","[' Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 18\n\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the European Commission (the “Commission”) announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”).

Which antitrust lawsuit has the DOJ filed against Apple Inc. and what relief is sought?,"As of my last update in October 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc. primarily focused on the company's App Store practices. The lawsuit alleges that Apple has engaged in anti-competitive behavior by maintaining a monopoly over the distribution of apps on iOS devices, which stifles competition and harms consumers.

The relief sought by the DOJ typically includes measures to promote competition, such as requiring Apple to change its App Store policies, allowing alternative app distribution methods, or possibly imposing fines. The goal is to create a more competitive environment that benefits consumers and developers alike.

"How is the adjusted cost for the Company's marketable securities calculated based on fair value, unrealized gains/losses, and types of securities held?","The adjusted cost for a company's marketable securities is primarily calculated based on the fair value of those securities, taking into account any unrealized gains or losses. Here's a breakdown of how this calculation typically works:

1. **Fair Value Measurement**: Marketable securities are generally reported at their fair value. Fair value is determined based on market prices for the securities, which can be obtained from active markets or through other valuation techniques if an active market does not exist.

2. **Unrealized Gains and Losses**: 
   - **Unrealized Gains**: These are increases in the fair value of securities that have not yet been sold. For example, if a security was purchased for $100 and its current fair value is $120, there is an unrealized gain of $20.
   - **Unrealized Losses**: Conversely, if the fair value of the same security drops to $80, there is an unrealized loss of $20.

3. **Types of Securities Held**: The accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses can vary depending on the classification of the securities:
   - **Trading Securities**: For securities classified as trading, unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. The adjusted cost would reflect the original cost adjusted for these gains and losses.
   - **Available-for-Sale Securities**: For available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement. The adjusted cost would still consider the original cost but would also reflect any unrealized gains or losses in the equity section of the balance sheet.
   - **Held-to-Maturity Securities**: These are recorded at amortized cost, so unrealized gains and losses are not recognized as they are intended to be held until maturity.

4. **Calculation of Adjusted Cost**: 
   - For trading securities: 
     \[
     \text{Adjusted Cost} = \text{Original Cost} + \text{Unrealized Gains} - \text{Unrealized Losses}
     \]
   - For available-for-sale securities, while the adjusted cost may still be the original cost, the total value reported on the balance sheet would include the impact of unrealized gains and losses in equity.

5. **Regular Review and Reporting**: Companies are required to review the fair value of their marketable securities regularly and report any changes in their financial statements in accordance with the relevant accounting standards (such as GAAP or IFRS).

In summary, the adjusted cost of a company's marketable securities reflects the original purchase price adjusted for unrealized gains and losses, with the specific treatment depending on the classification of the securities.","['September 30, 2023\n\nAdjusted Cost\n\nUnrealized Gains\n\nUnrealized Losses\n\nFair Value\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCurrent Marketable Securities\n\nNon-Current Marketable Securities\n\nCash\n\n$ 28,359 $\n\n— $\n\n— $ 28,359 $\n\n28,359 $\n\n— $\n\n—\n\nLevel 1:\n\nMoney market funds\n\n481\n\n—\n\n—\n\n481\n\n481\n\n—\n\n—\n\nMutual funds and equity securities\n\n442\n\n12\n\n(26)\n\n428\n\n—\n\n428\n\n—\n\nSubtotal\n\n923\n\n12\n\n(26)\n\n909\n\n481\n\n428\n\n—\n\nLevel 2 (1):\n\nU.S. Treasury securities\n\n19,406\n\n—\n\n(1,292)\n\n18,114\n\n35\n\n5,468\n\n12,611\n\nU.S. agency securities\n\n5,736\n\n—\n\n(600)\n\n5,136\n\n36\n\n271\n\n4,829\n\nNon-U.S. government securities\n\n17,533\n\n6\n\n(1,048)\n\n16,491\n\n—\n\n11,332\n\n5,159\n\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n\n1,354\n\n—\n\n—\n\n1,354\n\n1,034\n\n320\n\n—\n\nCommercial paper\n\n608\n\n—\n\n—\n\n608\n\n—\n\n608\n\n—\n\nCorporate debt securities\n\n76,840\n\n6\n\n(5,956)\n\n70,890\n\n20\n\n12,627\n\n58,243\n\nMunicipal securities\n\n628\n\n—\n\n(26)\n\n602\n\n—\n\n192\n\n410\n\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n\n22,365\n\n6\n\n(2,735)\n\n19,636\n\n—\n\n344\n\n19,292\n\nSubtotal\n\n144,470\n\n18\n\n(11,657)\n\n132,831\n\n1,125\n\n31,162\n\n100,544\n\nTotal (2)\n\n$ 173,752 $\n\n30 $\n\n(11,683) $ 162,099 $\n\n29,965 $\n\n31,590 $\n\n100,544\n\n(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\n(2) As of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $14.0 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.\n\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of March 30, 2024 (in millions):\n\nDue after 1 year through 5 years\n\n$\n\n67,987\n\nDue after 5 years through 10 years\n\n9,108\n\nDue after 10 years\n\n18,092\n\nTotal fair value\n\n$\n\n95,187\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\n\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
