What allegations has Epic Games made against Apple in their lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California?,"Epic Games has made allegations against Apple in their lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming violations of federal and state antitrust laws, as well as California’s unfair competition law, based on the operation of Apple's App Store. The District Court ruled in favor of Apple on nine out of ten counts in Epic's claim, but found that certain provisions of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines violated California’s unfair competition law. The court issued an injunction preventing Apple from prohibiting developers from including external links in their apps that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple's in-app purchasing.","[' Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 18\n\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the European Commission (the “Commission”) announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. If the Commission concludes that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and will continue to engage with the Commission as it conducts its investigations.\n\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and 16 state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nEpic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On March 13, 2024, Epic filed a motion with the California District Court disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction. The Company has filed an opposition to Epic’s motion. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

How is shareholders' equity calculated and what components are included in it?,"Shareholders' equity is calculated as the total of several components, which typically include:

1. **Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital**: This represents the funds raised by the company through the issuance of shares. It includes the par value of the shares issued and any additional amount paid by investors over the par value.

2. **Retained Earnings (or Accumulated Deficit)**: This is the cumulative amount of net income that has been retained in the company rather than paid out as dividends. If the company has incurred losses, this can result in an accumulated deficit.

3. **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)**: This includes other comprehensive income items that are not included in net income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on investments, and pension plan adjustments.

In the case of Apple Inc., the total shareholders' equity at the end of the reporting period is calculated by summing these components. For example, as of September 30, 2023, Apple reported total shareholders' equity of $62,146 million, which includes the ending balances of common stock and additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income/loss.","['Adjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included\n\nin net income\n\n59\n\n62\n\n134\n\n127\n\nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on\n\nmarketable debt securities\n\n52\n\n1,465\n\n3,172\n\n2,430\n\nTotal other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\n418\n\n1,166\n\n2,492\n\n(637)\n\nTotal comprehensive income\n\n$\n\n24,054 $\n\n25,326 $\n\n60,044 $\n\n53,521\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 2\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited) (In millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and par value)\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nASSETS:\n\nCurrent assets:\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n32,695 $\n\nMarketable securities\n\n34,455\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n21,837\n\nVendor non-trade receivables\n\n19,313\n\nInventories\n\n6,232\n\nOther current assets\n\n13,884\n\nTotal current assets\n\n128,416\n\nNon-current assets:\n\nMarketable securities\n\n95,187\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n43,546\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n70,262\n\nTotal non-current assets\n\n208,995\n\nTotal assets\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable\n\n$\n\n45,753 $\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n57,298\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n8,012\n\nCommercial paper\n\n1,997\n\nTerm debt\n\n10,762\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n123,822\n\nNon-current liabilities:\n\nTerm debt\n\n91,831\n\nOther non-current liabilities\n\n47,564\n\nTotal non-current liabilities\n\n139,395\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n263,217\n\nCommitments and contingencies\n\nShareholders’ equity:\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital, $0.00001 par value: 50,400,000 shares\n\nauthorized; 15,337,686 and 15,550,061 shares issued and outstanding, respectively\n\n78,815\n\nRetained earnings/(Accumulated deficit)\n\n4,339\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n(8,960)\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity\n\n74,194\n\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 3\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\n29,965\n\n31,590\n\n29,508\n\n31,477\n\n6,331\n\n14,695\n\n143,566\n\n100,544\n\n43,715\n\n64,758\n\n209,017\n\n352,583\n\n62,611\n\n58,829\n\n8,061\n\n5,985\n\n9,822\n\n145,308\n\n95,281\n\n49,848\n\n145,129\n\n290,437\n\n73,812\n\n(214)\n\n(11,452)\n\n62,146\n\n352,583\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (Unaudited) (In millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSix Months Ended\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity, beginning balances\n\n$\n\n74,100 $\n\n56,727 $\n\n62,146 $\n\n50,672\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital:\n\nBeginning balances\n\n75,236\n\n66,399\n\n73,812\n\n64,849\n\nCommon stock issued\n\n752\n\n690\n\n752\n\n690\n\nCommon stock withheld related to net share settlement\n\nof equity awards\n\n(222)\n\n(281)\n\n(1,882)\n\n(1,715)\n\n']","Shareholders' equity is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets.

How does the company adjust its cost in relation to unrealized gains and losses in its financial statements?,"The company adjusts its cost in relation to unrealized gains and losses by reporting these adjustments in its financial statements under the categories of ""Adjusted Cost,"" ""Unrealized Gains,"" and ""Unrealized Losses."" The adjusted cost reflects the original cost of the assets, while unrealized gains and losses represent the changes in the fair value of those assets that have not yet been realized through sales.

For example, as of September 30, 2023, the company reported total adjusted costs of $173,752 million, with unrealized gains of $30 million and unrealized losses of $(11,683) million. The fair value of the assets, which includes these adjustments, is reported as $162,099 million. This method allows the company to provide a clear picture of the current valuation of its assets while still maintaining a record of their original cost.","['September 30, 2023\n\nAdjusted Cost\n\nUnrealized Gains\n\nUnrealized Losses\n\nFair Value\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCurrent Marketable Securities\n\nNon-Current Marketable Securities\n\nCash\n\n$ 28,359 $\n\n— $\n\n— $ 28,359 $\n\n28,359 $\n\n— $\n\n—\n\nLevel 1:\n\nMoney market funds\n\n481\n\n—\n\n—\n\n481\n\n481\n\n—\n\n—\n\nMutual funds and equity securities\n\n442\n\n12\n\n(26)\n\n428\n\n—\n\n428\n\n—\n\nSubtotal\n\n923\n\n12\n\n(26)\n\n909\n\n481\n\n428\n\n—\n\nLevel 2 (1):\n\nU.S. Treasury securities\n\n19,406\n\n—\n\n(1,292)\n\n18,114\n\n35\n\n5,468\n\n12,611\n\nU.S. agency securities\n\n5,736\n\n—\n\n(600)\n\n5,136\n\n36\n\n271\n\n4,829\n\nNon-U.S. government securities\n\n17,533\n\n6\n\n(1,048)\n\n16,491\n\n—\n\n11,332\n\n5,159\n\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n\n1,354\n\n—\n\n—\n\n1,354\n\n1,034\n\n320\n\n—\n\nCommercial paper\n\n608\n\n—\n\n—\n\n608\n\n—\n\n608\n\n—\n\nCorporate debt securities\n\n76,840\n\n6\n\n(5,956)\n\n70,890\n\n20\n\n12,627\n\n58,243\n\nMunicipal securities\n\n628\n\n—\n\n(26)\n\n602\n\n—\n\n192\n\n410\n\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n\n22,365\n\n6\n\n(2,735)\n\n19,636\n\n—\n\n344\n\n19,292\n\nSubtotal\n\n144,470\n\n18\n\n(11,657)\n\n132,831\n\n1,125\n\n31,162\n\n100,544\n\nTotal (2)\n\n$ 173,752 $\n\n30 $\n\n(11,683) $ 162,099 $\n\n29,965 $\n\n31,590 $\n\n100,544\n\n(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\n(2) As of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $14.0 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.\n\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of March 30, 2024 (in millions):\n\nDue after 1 year through 5 years\n\n$\n\n67,987\n\nDue after 5 years through 10 years\n\n9,108\n\nDue after 10 years\n\n18,092\n\nTotal fair value\n\n$\n\n95,187\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\n\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.

How does the issuance of common stock impact the shareholders' equity of Apple Inc.?,"The issuance of common stock impacts the shareholders' equity of Apple Inc. in the following ways:

1. **Increase in Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital**: When Apple issues common stock, it increases the balances in the ""Common stock and additional paid-in capital"" section of shareholders' equity. For example, in the year ended September 30, 2023, Apple issued $1,346 million in common stock, which contributed to an increase in the ending balance of this category to $73,812 million.

2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**: The issuance of common stock contributes to the overall total shareholders' equity. As seen in the consolidated statements, the total shareholders' equity increased from $50,672 million at the beginning of the year to $62,146 million at the end of the year, influenced by factors such as the issuance of common stock, net income, and other adjustments.

3. **Dilution of Existing Shares**: While the issuance of new shares increases the total equity, it can also dilute the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This means that the value of each existing share may decrease if the earnings are not sufficient to offset the increase in the number of shares outstanding.

In summary, the issuance of common stock increases the common stock and additional paid-in capital, thereby raising total shareholders' equity, but it may also dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.","['Adjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included\n\nin net income\n\n59\n\n62\n\n134\n\n127\n\nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on\n\nmarketable debt securities\n\n52\n\n1,465\n\n3,172\n\n2,430\n\nTotal other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\n418\n\n1,166\n\n2,492\n\n(637)\n\nTotal comprehensive income\n\n$\n\n24,054 $\n\n25,326 $\n\n60,044 $\n\n53,521\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 2\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited) (In millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and par value)\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nASSETS:\n\nCurrent assets:\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n32,695 $\n\nMarketable securities\n\n34,455\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n21,837\n\nVendor non-trade receivables\n\n19,313\n\nInventories\n\n6,232\n\nOther current assets\n\n13,884\n\nTotal current assets\n\n128,416\n\nNon-current assets:\n\nMarketable securities\n\n95,187\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n43,546\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n70,262\n\nTotal non-current assets\n\n208,995\n\nTotal assets\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable\n\n$\n\n45,753 $\n\nOther current liabilities\n\n57,298\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n8,012\n\nCommercial paper\n\n1,997\n\nTerm debt\n\n10,762\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n123,822\n\nNon-current liabilities:\n\nTerm debt\n\n91,831\n\nOther non-current liabilities\n\n47,564\n\nTotal non-current liabilities\n\n139,395\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n263,217\n\nCommitments and contingencies\n\nShareholders’ equity:\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital, $0.00001 par value: 50,400,000 shares\n\nauthorized; 15,337,686 and 15,550,061 shares issued and outstanding, respectively\n\n78,815\n\nRetained earnings/(Accumulated deficit)\n\n4,339\n\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n(8,960)\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity\n\n74,194\n\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n\n$\n\n337,411 $\n\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 3\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\n29,965\n\n31,590\n\n29,508\n\n31,477\n\n6,331\n\n14,695\n\n143,566\n\n100,544\n\n43,715\n\n64,758\n\n209,017\n\n352,583\n\n62,611\n\n58,829\n\n8,061\n\n5,985\n\n9,822\n\n145,308\n\n95,281\n\n49,848\n\n145,129\n\n290,437\n\n73,812\n\n(214)\n\n(11,452)\n\n62,146\n\n352,583\n\nApple Inc.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (Unaudited) (In millions, except per-share amounts)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSix Months Ended\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity, beginning balances\n\n$\n\n74,100 $\n\n56,727 $\n\n62,146 $\n\n50,672\n\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital:\n\nBeginning balances\n\n75,236\n\n66,399\n\n73,812\n\n64,849\n\nCommon stock issued\n\n752\n\n690\n\n752\n\n690\n\nCommon stock withheld related to net share settlement\n\nof equity awards\n\n(222)\n\n(281)\n\n(1,882)\n\n(1,715)\n\n']",The issuance of common stock impacts the shareholders' equity of Apple Inc. by increasing the common stock and additional paid-in capital.

How do EU DMA investigations affect Apple's financial reporting and fines?,"The EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) investigations can materially affect Apple's financial reporting and potential fines in several ways. Compliance with the DMA, which Apple is required to meet by March 2024, may necessitate changes to its App Store operations, including how developers interact with consumers and how Apple manages app distribution. 

If the investigations result in adverse findings against Apple, the company could face significant fines and may be required to alter its business practices related to the App Store. Such changes could adversely impact Apple's business, results of operations, and financial condition. The potential for legal proceedings and claims arising from these investigations could also lead to increased liabilities and costs, further affecting Apple's financial reporting.

Overall, the outcomes of the DMA investigations, including any fines or required operational changes, could have a substantial negative impact on Apple's financial health and market reputation.","[' Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nApple Inc. | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | 18\n\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the European Commission (the “Commission”) announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”).

"How is the adjusted cost for the Company's marketable securities calculated based on fair value, unrealized gains/losses, and types of securities held?","The adjusted cost for the Company's marketable securities is calculated based on the original cost of the securities, adjusted for unrealized gains and losses.

3. **Unrealized Losses**: These are decreases in the fair value of the securities that have not yet been realized through a sale.
