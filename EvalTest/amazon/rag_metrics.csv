How is stock-based compensation recognized and accounted for in the financial statements of the company?,"Stock-based compensation is recognized and accounted for in the financial statements of the company as follows:

1. **Expense Recognition**: The company records share-based compensation expense in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years 2023, 2022, and 2021, the share-based compensation expenses were $10,833 million, $9,038 million, and $7,906 million, respectively.

2. **Income Tax Benefit**: The company also recognizes an income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense. For the same years, the income tax benefits were $(3,421) million for 2023, $(4,002) million for 2022, and $(4,056) million for 2021.

3. **Unrecognized Compensation Cost**: As of September 30, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) was $18.6 billion. The company expects to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.

4. **Shareholders' Equity**: Share-based compensation also affects the shareholders' equity section of the financial statements. For instance, in the year ended September 30, 2023, the company recorded $11,138 million in share-based compensation within the common stock and additional paid-in capital.

Overall, stock-based compensation is treated as an expense in the income statement and impacts both the tax benefits and the equity section of the financial statements.","['25\n\n2026\n\n2027\n\n2028\n\nThereafter\n\nTotal\n\nScheduled vesting — restricted stock units\n\n218.3\n\n124.6\n\n48.7\n\n11.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.7\n\n405.8\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $18.3 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements.

What are the goals for Amazon.com in terms of Internet commerce for 1998?,I don't know the answer.,"['.com.\n\nGoals for 1998\n\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\n\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\n\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\n\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n\n1997 was indeed an incredible year.

How does Amazon enable sellers to use third-party freight partners through the Partnered Carrier Program?,I don't know the answer.,"[' we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. To ship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers to use either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered Carrier Program. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times, we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along with automated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to manage their own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packages to their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillment network as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered, we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\n\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom. You can keep your primitives to yourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and business to reap the benefits of rapid innovation. You can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (as we have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external, paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently released logistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. You’re only constrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\n\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro areas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\n\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large and growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods (e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to any Amazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\n\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of as a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventually allow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\n\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other medication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed across businesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\n\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience. Releasing the first couple primitive services can sometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these building blocks come together. I’ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another. In the last 10 years, we’ve tried several Health experiments across various teams—but they were not driven by our primitives approach. This changed in 2022 when we applied our primitives thinking to the enormous global healthcare problem and opportunity. We’ve now created several important building blocks to help\n\ntransform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One Medical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growing success, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutrition opportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon']","Amazon enables sellers to use third-party freight partners through the Partnered Carrier Program by offering them the option to ship inventory from the border or domestically to storage facilities using these partners.

What factors contribute to the increase in fulfillment costs in 2023 compared to the prior year?,"The increase in fulfillment costs in 2023 compared to the prior year can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Higher Services Costs**: The documents indicate that there were higher costs associated with services, which contributed to the overall increase in fulfillment costs.

2. **Weakness in Foreign Currencies**: The impact of foreign currency weakness relative to the U.S. dollar affected both product and service margins, which can indirectly influence fulfillment costs.

3. **Increased Services Net Sales**: Although higher services net sales can lead to increased costs, it also suggests that the volume of services provided may have increased, which could lead to higher fulfillment costs.

These factors combined suggest that fulfillment costs were influenced by both operational increases and external economic conditions.","[' the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.\n\nThe increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product\n\nand shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies and lower transportation rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $254 million in 2023.\n\nShipping costs were $83.5 billion and $89.5 billion in 2022 and 2023. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\n\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure” as we leverage a shared\n\ninfrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\n\nFulfillment\n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International\n\nfulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and\n\n26\n\nfulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\n\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased\n\nsales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $52 million in 2023.\n\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet\n\nanticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\n\nTechnology and Infrastructure\n\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\n\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the\n\ncustomer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and\n\nselling activities, including']","The increase in fulfillment costs in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in the fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies.

How did the launch of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) contribute to the development of AWS infrastructure services?,I don't know the answer.,"[' didn’t do any one job that well.\n\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly flexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service (“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability and availability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launched S3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered, why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 and Amazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services that would allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and without having to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these building blocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider), whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.), industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox, Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other U.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumer businesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV), Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which AWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate.\n\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?\n\nPursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to combine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve.\n\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities around warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers. As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these same logistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduce Fulfillment by Amazon (“FBA”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to store items, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products being available for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about 70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchants began to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillment capabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on their own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information with Amazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime members can check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on Buy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\n\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to develop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fast delivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs, and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers to store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set of lower-cost, upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship functions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we’ll run out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream\n\nwarehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own last mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellers wanting to use Amazon.\n\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon consumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, for sellers needing help importing products,']","The launch of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in August 2006 contributed to the development of AWS infrastructure services by providing a flexible and scalable computing service that allowed developers to build a wide range of applications and services without the need to manage physical hardware or data centers.

Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment.

For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $155.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.0 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\n\nIncluded in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing\n\nobligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax liabilities.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.

What challenges did Amazon face in the online bookselling market in 1998 while aiming for expansion?,I don't know the answer.,"['.com.\n\nGoals for 1998\n\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\n\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\n\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\n\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\n\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\n\nJeffrey P.
